udevil Authentication Instructions


  Each version of udevil is distributed with a file named
  udevil-x.x.x.SHA256.asc (where x.x.x is the current version number) which is
  used to authenticate distributed files.


Why Authenticate?

  Verifying the authenticity of downloaded files prior to installation is
  important to ensure that your download is not corrupt and that no one has
  tampered with the server holding the files.


1) If you don't already have IgnorantGuru's CURRENT key on your keyring:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 0x7977070A723C6CCB696C0B0227A5AC5A01937621
    (if you receive an error, try again)
    
  Also visually verify that the given fingerprint matches the one shown here:
    http://igurublog.wordpress.com/contact-ignorantguru/

2) Download one or more files (the first is required):

   udevil-x.x.x.SHA256.asc
   udevil-x.x.x.tar.xz
   udevil-x.x.x-installer.sh
   udevil_x.x.x-1_all.deb


3) Check signature and files:

   gpg -d udevil-x.x.x.SHA256.asc | sha256sum --check

   This should report a good signature and an OK for each file present:  

     gpg: Signature made <SIGNATURE DATE> using DSA key ID 01937621    <--
 --> udevil-x.x.x.tar.xz: OK
 --> udevil-x.x.x-installer.sh: OK
 --> udevil_x.x.x-1_all.deb: OK
 --> gpg: Good signature from IgnorantGuru <EMAIL>
     gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
     gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
     sha256sum: WARNING: x lines are improperly formatted

   If "BAD signature" or the wrong key ID is reported, or if FAILED appears
   next to any file you plan to use, DO NOT USE the file.  A "key is not
   certified" warning (shown above) is normal and can be safely ignored if
   you visually verified the key fingerprint in step 1.
